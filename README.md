# Exoplanet detection

## Getting Started
This project has been done as part of Inter IIT Tech Meet 2018 which was held in IIT Madras. It is to be noted that this repository solely comprises the code, while the datasets and trained models have not been included in order to remain compliant with the regulations set forth by the competition.

## Requirements
- Keras
- pandas
- Numpy
- scipy
- matplotlib

## File Distribution
- ``vae_model.py`` defines and trains the variational autoencoder.
- ``test.py`` uses the trained model to make predictions on the given testing dataset.
